<h1> Machine Learning Simplified</h1>
<br>
The goal of these simple projects is to simplify all my learning in the last 3 years into easy applicable ML. 

You can jump even deeper into some complex issues like oversampling, data cleaning but the point is how can you take data and immediately apply it.

This is the basic ML classification, regression, unsupervised learning methods, Reinforcement Learning, NLP and Deep Learning. 

<p><b>Data Scientist and a Machine Learning</b> expert. I share my knowledge by simplifying all my learning, algorithms, and coding libraries.</p>

<b>The codes can be viewed in R and Python.</b>

Part 1 - Data Preprocessing

Part 2 - Regression: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVR, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression

Part 3 - Classification: Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification

Part 4 - Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering

Part 5 - Association Rule Learning: Apriori, Eclat

Part 6 - Reinforcement Learning: Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling

Part 7 - Natural Language Processing: Bag-of-words model and algorithms for NLP
